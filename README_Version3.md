# Me-game — Improved

This patch modernizes and improves the Me-game front-end:

- Responsive, cleaner UI and better styling
- Player images with fallback placeholder
- National teams with flags and team selection
- Search, filter by position and team
- Drag & drop players into your team's roster
- Players can be "owned" once and "selected" once; selection is unique (one selected player at a time)
- Local persistence via localStorage (save & export/import JSON)
- Accessible controls and keyboard support

How to use
1. Add asset images:
   - Player images: images/players/*.jpg (or update paths in script.js)
   - Team flags: images/flags/*.png
   - Placeholder image: images/placeholder-player.png

2. Drop these files into your repo root (index.html, style.css, script.js, README.md).

3. Open index.html in a browser or serve via a static server (e.g. `npx http-server`).

4. Interact:
   - Search and filter players.
   - Click "Own" to buy a player (can't own twice).
   - Click "Select" to select a player (only one selected at a time).
   - Drag players into the roster, or use "Assign →" to add to the currently selected national team.
   - Save to localStorage, export/import JSON to share state.

Next improvements you might want
- Persist to a backend API to share progress between users.
- Add player stats, costs, and a currency system for buying players.
- Limit roster size and enforce formations/position rules.
- Add animations and sound for richer feedback.
- Add unit tests and linting, or break UI into components (React/Vue) for larger scale.
