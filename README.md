# Me-game — Fun Update!

**Features:**
- Real player images (from randomuser.me; fallback avatars if those fail).
- Team flags (local or CDN fallback).
- Points and money system.
- Players cost money to own/select, and you can lose points/money.
- Playful feedback and animations.
- All previous features: search, filters, drag & drop, save/export/import.

**How to use:**
- Open index.html in your browser.
- Click "Own" ($10) or "Select" ($5) on a player card.
- Assign players to your team by drag-and-drop or "Assign →".
- Try "Lose Point" or "Lose $10" for fun!
- Use the scoreboard to track your score and money.

**Next ideas:**
- Add more players and teams.
- Add "earn" actions (mini-games, quizzes, events).
- Add sound effects or confetti animations for feedback.
- Persist scores and history to server for multiplayer.

**How images work:**
- Player images use remote URLs (randomuser.me); if not available, fallback to fun avatars.
- Team flags use local files, else CDN flags.
